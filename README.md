# 📊 Netflix Data Analysis: From Cleaning to Interactive Dashboard 

## 📖 Introduction

Have you ever wondered **what kind of content Netflix adds every year?** Which genres dominate the platform? When do they release the most movies?

This project is a **comprehensive Netflix data analysis**, where I:

✅ Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using **Python & Pandas**

✅ Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualized insights using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**

✅ Created an **advanced interactive dashboard in Tableau**

## 🔄 Project Workflow

This project follows a structured approach:

1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** - Handled missing values, fixed date formats, and standardized columns.

2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Extracted meaningful insights using Python.

3️⃣ **Visualizations** - Plotted key trends like monthly content releases, genre distribution, and country-wise additions and etc.

4️⃣ **Interactive Dashboard** - Created a powerful Tableau Dashboard for dynamic exploration which is also easy to interact with.

## 📂 Dataset Information

📄 Source: Netflix dataset (CSV format)

📊 Size: 6000+ entries and 35 attributes

🔑 Key columns: title, type (Movie/TV Show), director, country, date_added, duration, listed_in (genre).

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Before diving into analysis, I:

✅ Replaced missing values (e.g., director was filled with "Unknown").

✅ Converted date_added into datetime format and extracted year & month.

✅ Dropped the columns which were unneccesary for the analysis (e.g., cast and descriptiom).

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations

I used **pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn** to uncover insights like:

📌 Total nuumber of Movies and TV Shows

📌 Monthly and yearly movie & TV show releases

📌 Top genres on Netflix

📌 Country-wise content distribution

## 📊 Interactive Tableau Dashboard

I designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore Netflix trends dynamically.

📄How to explore? 

The first line of visualization is the information about the Movies or TV shows. Select the type as Movies or TV shows and select a movie/TV show from the title. It then displays the rating, duration, release year, date added, genre and description about the Movie/TV show.

The second and the third line of the dashboard is the overall visualization of the dataset. Explore according to your wish.
